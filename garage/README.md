# garage

An application to control and use the services of an automatic garage using IOT which was my graduation project.

## Services and Packages Used

  -Cupertino_icons
  
  -Firebase_core
  
  -Cloud_firestore
  
  -Firebase_auth

The main idea is an app from which the user can be connected to the Garage services through the cloud using Iot.
